# Assembly Instructions

Mill all acrylic parts using the provided svg files: 


[Top Mounting Plate](mounting_plate_top.svg)   
[Middle Mounting Plate](mounting_plate_mid.svg)  
[Bottom Mounting Plate](mounting_plate_bot.svg)  
[Motor Clip A](motor_clipA.svg)  
[Motor Clip B](motor_clipB.svg)  


Snap motor_clipA onto each of the motors.

Insert one motor into the bottom plate and slip motor_clipB onto the bottom of the plate.  Attach 5 screws and nuts securely.

Insert the other stepper motor into mounting_plat_mid and slip motor_clipB onto the bottom of the plate.  Attach 4 screws loosely with nuts.

Attach a timing pulley to the middle stepper motor.

Insert sleeve bearing into the mid plate and top plate.

Attach the top plate to the mid plate using the standoffs.

Insert the tube, timing pulley, and timing belt between the bearings,  The tube should rotate freely.  The timing pulley should be secured to the tube.  Do not over tighten.

Wrap the timing belt around the stepper motor timing pulley.

Adjust the middle stepper motor until the timing belt has the proper tension.  The timing belt does not need to be too taunt.  Tighten the 4 screws holding the stepper in place.
