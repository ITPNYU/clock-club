### Insipiration

[The Chronophage](http://www.johnctaylor.com/the-chronophage/) by John C. Taylor. An analog clock with an insect theme. How he creates the lighting effect without changing the lights is interesting.

[Time Traveller](http://mrjoneswatches.com/time-traveller/) by Mr. Jones Watches (Crispin Jones). The one moving hand has a tall building for every time zone, so it tells time in all time zones simultaneously. A dot tells the seconds.

[The 10,000 Year Clock](http://longnow.org/clock/) by the Longnow Foundation. Originated by Danny Hillis, Brian Eno, and Kevin Kelly, the 10K year clock is a monument intended to help encourage very long-term thinking. The basic premise of the Longnow foundation is this: civilization has been around ~10,000 years. If we plan to make it another 10,000, we need to get better at long term thinking.

[Bulbdial Monochrome Kit](http://shop.evilmadscientist.com/productsmenu/791#) One of Evil Mad Scientist Labs' clock kits. Does a wonderful job at projecting the hands of the clock as shadows.

[Eclisse Table Lamp](http://www.ylighting.com/artemide-eclisse-table-lamp.html) by Artemide. Lamp that takes inspiration from the phases of the moon.

[Working Watch Cufflinks](http://www.amazon.com/Watch-Working-Round-Cufflinks-Presentation/dp/B00PJ1P9TC/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1461955802&sr=8-4&keywords=working+watch+cufflinks) Why not?
