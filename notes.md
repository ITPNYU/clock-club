From Jeff 5 Jun: I enjoyed this, and also enjoyed today the Bantam Tools stream Ben mentioned, showing how [Nicholas Manousos](http://www.nicholasmanousos.com/) used the mill to cut parts, including escapements and wheels (brass stamp blanks for stock, .3mm end mill).

He mentioned a key watchmaking book by George Daniels, and in looking that up, I came across Daniels' "Space Traveler" watch and thought of Che-Wei and the [discussion of watches in space](http://www.danielslondon.com/daniels-watches/the-space-traveller/ )

It has two similar but independent wheel trains, one for solar time and one for sidereal star time. Tons of info, and some amazing hand-drawn plans, [here](https://watchesbysjx.com/2019/06/george-daniels-space-traveller-i-pocket-watch.html)

From Will: Here’s a [link to a paper that’s about to come out](https://www.dropbox.com/s/8hkhgy589qjom1j/OloRadio_DIS2020.pdf?dl=0) that details the music player we built that explores different chronological and non-chronological temporal modalities with your listening history:

Also, if interested here’s a [different kind of slow music player](https://www.dropbox.com/s/4g1iaykuif4nsnr/OllyFieldStudy_CHI2019.pdf?dl=0) with reduced control and only inquires into a chronological encoding of time, but that explores how the listening history archive can slowly age over time
