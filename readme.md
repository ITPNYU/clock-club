# *"The first rule of Clock Club is that no one checks the time at Clock Club."*

## About This Repository

This repo is written with students and scholars of interactive design in mind. It's a collection of materials we've gathered for our own projects and interest in the subject of time. There are software examples of how to make clocks here, microcontroller-driven hardware examples, and fabrication examples of how to make hands and mechanisms. There are also readings and links to other material we've found useful.

## Who We Are

Clock Club started at NYU's [ITP](https://itp.nyu.edu) in about 2016 because a handful of us like making timepieces and wanted external motivation and convesation to work on them. The group includes designers, programmers, electronics hobbyists, fabricators, and scholars.

## What You Need To Know

We assume you're interested in time and timekeeping, probably have a background in interactive design, but aren't necessarily an engineer or professional programmer. You know a little about computer programming. Examples are written in a few programming frameworks that are common in interaction design programs. For further reading on some of the basics we assume, you might want to check out the [ITP Physical Computing Site](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/), the [ITP Fabrication Site](https://itp.nyu.edu/fab/), or the [ITP Intro to Computational Media site](https://github.com/ITPNYU/ICM-2018).

The site is organized into the following sections:

* [Projects](Projects) - clocks, mechanisms, or other time-related examples that we've built, with instructions and/or source material
* [Bibliography](bibliography) - further reading on time and clocks
* [Timepieces](works) - examples of clocks, watches, and other time-related devices, sculptures, buildings, etc.
* [Organizations](organizations) - societies, foundations, schools, and other time-related organizations
* [Tools](tools) - software and hardware tools that we've used for timepieces
* [Parts and Suppliers](parts) - places to get stuff to make timepieces.
* [Notes](notes) - things that have not been organized elsewhere. _(Contributors: please move things from here to other sections when you see where they belong)_
