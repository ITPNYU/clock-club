## Projects In This Repository

* [Clocks in JavaScript using p5.js](https://github.com/ITPNYU/clock-club/tree/master/P5JS_examples) - a collection of JavaScript clock examples using [p5.js](https://p5js.org)
* Arduino-Based Clock Examples
   * [Programmable LED Clocks](https://github.com/ITPNYU/clock-club/tree/master/Programmable_LED_examples) - clock examples using programmable LEDs such as the WS2812 (NeoPixel), APA102C, etc.
   * [Setting the Time on a Microcontroller-Driven LED (or other) Clock Project](https://github.com/ITPNYU/clock-club/tree/master/Microcontroller_Time_Setting_Methods). 
   * [Microcontroller-Driven Quartz Clocks](https://github.com/ITPNYU/clock-club/tree/master/Analog_Clock_Control) - how to control a standard quartz-clock from a microcontroller
* [Making Your Own Clock Hands](Making_Custom_Clock_Hands) - how to make clock hands, mostly for quartz clocks, using a small CNC mill.
* [Two Stepper Motor-Driven Clock Mechanism](https://github.com/ITPNYU/clock-club/tree/master/two_stepper_clock_mechanism) - a custom clock mechanism designed by Ben Light, which uses two stepper motors. The hands are not linked by gears, so they can be driven independently of each other.
* Notes on controlling the [VID28-05](VID28-05_mechanism), a two-stepper, concentric shaft mechanism, useful for when you want to make clocks where the two hands are not coupled to each other's movement. 
* [What Not To Do Clock](WhatNotToDoClock) - a tabletop clock device built for the [ITP Tangible Interaction](https://itp.nyu.edu/classes/tangible-interaction) class by Tom Igoe and Ben Light.
