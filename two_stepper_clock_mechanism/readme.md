Two-motor Clock Mechanism For Custom Movements

A common problem for designers wanting to make mechanical clocks is that existing clocks have a fixed gear ratio: the minute hand turns sixty times per revolution of the hour hand, and the second hand, if there is one, turns sixty times per revolution of the minute hand. Those who want to make timepieces with different ratios have to design a custom mechanism. To offer a starting point, we designed a mechanism which uses two stepper motors to achieve this. Stepper motor control is a common technique taught in our physical computing classes, and is common in other design programs as well, so this seemed like a useful approach.

The assembly is made up of seven CNC’d pieces of acrylic and off the shelf components.

The folder contains the Bill of Materials for the off the shelf parts, the 2D sag files for the CNC’d acrylic, and assembly instructions.
