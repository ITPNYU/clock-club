# A Collection of Time and Clock-Related Works

## Public Clocks

[The Chronophage](http://www.johnctaylor.com/the-chronophage/) by John C. Taylor. An analog clock with an insect theme. How he creates the lighting effect without changing the lights is interesting.

[The 10,000 Year Clock](http://longnow.org/clock/) by the Longnow Foundation. Originated by Danny Hillis, Brian Eno, and Kevin Kelly, the 10K year clock is a monument intended to help encourage very long-term thinking. The basic premise of the Longnow foundation is this: civilization has been around ~10,000 years. If we plan to make it another 10,000, we need to get better at long term thinking.

[Paolo Salvagione](https://www.autodesk.com/artist-in-residence/artists/paolo-salvagione) works on the Long Now clock and was a resident at Pier 9.

## Indoor Clocks

[Bulbdial Monochrome Kit](http://shop.evilmadscientist.com/productsmenu/791#) One of Evil Mad Scientist Labs' clock kits. Does a wonderful job at projecting the hands of the clock as shadows.


[11+ WORLD CLOCK](http://store.leibal.com/products/11-world-clock) by Leibal. Shows time in different time zones by rolling the clock.

[Sasa Clock](http://thorunndesign.com/independent-work/#/sasa/) by Thorunn Arnadottir. Counts time using a series of beads, not unlike a rosary.

[Luminance](http://ariellehein.com/) Arielle Hein's clock reflects sunrise and set.

[QlockTwo](http://qlocktwo.com/) a word clock.

[The Present](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/scottthrift/the-present) is a one year clock. The kickstarter mentions a circuit to slow the second tick down; this [Design Boom article](http://www.designboom.com/technology/worlds-first-year-long-clock-thepresent-by-m-ss-ng-p-eces/) mentions custom German mechanisms but those also seem to show the customization of a different MCU.

## Watches

[Time Traveller](http://mrjoneswatches.com/time-traveller/) by Mr. Jones Watches (Crispin Jones). The one moving hand has a tall building for every time zone, so it tells time in all time zones simultaneously. A dot tells the seconds.

[Long Distance Watch](http://www.kitmenkeung.com/) Kitmen Keung's dual-face watch, so you can always know what time it is at home.

[Slow Watch](https://www.slow-watches.com/the-store/slow-jo-38mm/slow-jo-22-all-black-mesh.html) Watch with a single hand that takes 25 hours to go around the face. By Slow Watches.

[Working Watch Cufflinks](http://www.amazon.com/Watch-Working-Round-Cufflinks-Presentation/dp/B00PJ1P9TC/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1461955802&sr=8-4&keywords=working+watch+cufflinks) Why not?

[Christiaan van der Klaauw](http://www.klaauw.com/) specializes in astronomical complications. JF - I like ones with spherical (rather than flat) moon phase indicators.

[Hodinkee](https://www.hodinkee.com/) has hi-res pictures of fancy watches.

## Orreries and Armillaries

[Aeroport Orly Ouest Horloge Astronomique](http://www.patrimoine-horloge.fr/as-orlyo.html) by Alfred Faullimel and others. A large yet compact depiction of several astronomic properties of the earth, moon, sun and solar system.

[Equinox](http://willware.blogspot.com/2008/07/3d-printer-project-at-victoria.html) is a sun-powered 3D printer similar to an armillary sphere (see above).


## Other Timepieces

[Eclisse Table Lamp](http://www.ylighting.com/artemide-eclisse-table-lamp.html) by Artemide. Lamp that takes inspiration from the phases of the moon.

[Continue Time](http://sandermulder.com/continue_time.html) Sander Mulder elegantly combines all three hands of a clock.

[O'clock. Time Design, Design Time](https://www.designboom.com/design/oclock-time-design-design-time-at-triennale-design-museum-milan/) An exhibit of timepieces at the Milan Triennale museum in 2011. Sadly, the catalog, which is very good, cannot be found online.
Here's [another review of it](https://www.wallpaper.com/art/oclock-time-design-design-time-show-milan).

[One Day Poem Pavilion](http://people.artcenter.edu/~jsong5/thesis/index.html) uses the sun's motion to project and animate a poem that changes through the course of a day and over seasons.

[Quadrature](http://quadrature.co/) has inspiring clock-adjacent work, including [Voyager](http://quadrature.co/work/voyager/)
