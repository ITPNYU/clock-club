### Insipiration

[The Chronophage](http://www.johnctaylor.com/the-chronophage/) by John C. Taylor. An analog clock with an insect theme. How he creates the lighting effect without changing the lights is interesting.

[Time Traveller](http://mrjoneswatches.com/time-traveller/) by Mr. Jones Watches (Crispin Jones). The one moving hand has a tall building for every time zone, so it tells time in all time zones simultaneously. A dot tells the seconds.

[The 10,000 Year Clock](http://longnow.org/clock/) by the Longnow Foundation. Originated by Danny Hillis, Brian Eno, and Kevin Kelly, the 10K year clock is a monument intended to help encourage very long-term thinking. The basic premise of the Longnow foundation is this: civilization has been around ~10,000 years. If we plan to make it another 10,000, we need to get better at long term thinking.

[Bulbdial Monochrome Kit](http://shop.evilmadscientist.com/productsmenu/791#) One of Evil Mad Scientist Labs' clock kits. Does a wonderful job at projecting the hands of the clock as shadows.

[Eclisse Table Lamp](http://www.ylighting.com/artemide-eclisse-table-lamp.html) by Artemide. Lamp that takes inspiration from the phases of the moon.

[Working Watch Cufflinks](http://www.amazon.com/Watch-Working-Round-Cufflinks-Presentation/dp/B00PJ1P9TC/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1461955802&sr=8-4&keywords=working+watch+cufflinks) Why not?

[Long Distance Watch](https://www.dezeenwatchstore.com/shop/mens-watches/long-distance-1-0/) Kitmen Keung's dual-face watch, so you can always know what time it is at home.

[Slow Watch](https://www.slow-watches.com/the-store/slow-jo-38mm/slow-jo-22-all-black-mesh.html) Watch with a single hand that takes 25 hours to go around the face. By Slow Watches.

[11+ WORLD CLOCK](http://store.leibal.com/products/11-world-clock) by Leibal. Shows time in different time zones by rolling the clock.

[Tumbler Alarm clock](http://store.leibal.com/collections/bathroom/products/norm-tumbler-alarm-clock) by Norm. Alarm clock that you turn off by turning it over.

[Felt Wall Clock](http://store.leibal.com/collections/bathroom/products/felt35) by Sebastian Herkner. A felt clock.

[A History of Braun part 2: Timepieces](http://www.core77.com/posts/24660/a-history-of-braun-design-part-2-timepieces-24660) Article on Dieter Rams' clock designs for Braun.

[Orrery Maker](http://www.orrerymaker.com/librarybooks.htm)

[Sasa Clock](http://thorunndesign.com/#/sasa/) by Thorunn Arnadottir. Counts time using a series of beads, not unlike a rosary.

[Aeroport Orly Ouest Horloge Astronomique](http://www.patrimoine-horloge.fr/as-orlyo.html) by Alfred Faullimel and others. A large yet compact depiction of several astronomic properties of the earth, moon, sun and solar system.

[Accutron patent](http://www.decadecounter.com/accutron/US3162006.pdf), one of several, that shows the electromagnetically driven tuning fork timing mechanism. [This page](http://www.decadecounter.com/accutron/docs.htm) has a list of several more Accutron documents.

[Hodinkee](https://www.hodinkee.com/) has hi-res pictures of fancy watches.

[Christiaan van der Klaauw](http://www.klaauw.com/) specializes in astronomical complications. JF - I like ones with spherical (rather than flat) moon phase indicators. 

[US Naval Observatory](http://aa.usno.navy.mil/imagery/moon) shows what the moon looks like right now.
