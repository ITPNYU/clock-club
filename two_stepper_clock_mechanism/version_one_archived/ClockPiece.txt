Clock Mechanism


2 Shaft Prototype


Two nested shafts controlled by two independent stepper motors.


Made mostly from off the shelf components and laser cut panels.  The most handmade part is the ⅜” tube with bushing ends.  I glued up the parts and turned down to the proper diameter on the metal lathe.
