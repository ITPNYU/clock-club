# Clock Club

*The first rule of Clock Club is that no one checks the time at Clock Club.*

This repository contains information on making clocks and timepieces.

## What You Should Know In Advance

This repo is written for students and scholars of interactive design. It assumes you know a little about computer programming. Examples are written in a few programming frameworks that are common in interaction design programs like NYU's [ITP](https://itp.nyu.edu), where this repo was developed. For further reading on some of the basics we assume, you might want to check out the [ITP Physical Computing Site](https://itp.nyu.edu/physcomp/), the [ITP Fabrication Site](https://itp.nyu.edu/fab/), or the [ITP Intro to Computational Media site](https://github.com/ITPNYU/ICM-2017).

### Insipiration Links

[The Chronophage](http://www.johnctaylor.com/the-chronophage/) by John C. Taylor. An analog clock with an insect theme. How he creates the lighting effect without changing the lights is interesting.

[Time Traveller](http://mrjoneswatches.com/time-traveller/) by Mr. Jones Watches (Crispin Jones). The one moving hand has a tall building for every time zone, so it tells time in all time zones simultaneously. A dot tells the seconds.

[The 10,000 Year Clock](http://longnow.org/clock/) by the Longnow Foundation. Originated by Danny Hillis, Brian Eno, and Kevin Kelly, the 10K year clock is a monument intended to help encourage very long-term thinking. The basic premise of the Longnow foundation is this: civilization has been around ~10,000 years. If we plan to make it another 10,000, we need to get better at long term thinking.

* [Concentric turntable bearings](http://www.aliexpress.com/item-img/18-450mm-Turntable-Bearing-Swivel-Plate-Lazy-Susan-New-Great-For-Mechanical-Projects/1586614309.html) like these might be helpful in astronimical mechanisms. Also available through [VXB](http://www.vxb.com/Hardware-Turntables-Lazy-Susans-Online-s/246.htm)
* [Klockit](http://www.klockit.com/) has raw clock parts.
* The [Takane](https://www.clockparts.com/time-and-tide-movement/) tide clock adds a reduction stage to the output of a more-or-less standard mechanism. It consists of a stack of gears in the ratio 57:58:59, thus reducing a 12 hour period (solar half-day) to 12h+25.2m (lunar half-day, tidal period). The 58 tooth gear is visible hanging below the main assembly. By running this mechanism at half speed, the hour hand corresponds to sun position and tide hand to moon position. Alternately, it may be possible to add the tide stage to an existing 24-hour movement for the same effect.
