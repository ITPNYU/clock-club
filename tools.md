# Tools and Platforms

Following are a number of tools and platforms, both software and hardware, that we've found useful in making time-related work.

## Hardware
* [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc) - microcontrollers
* [Raspberry Pi](http://raspberrypi.org/) - Linux-based microprocessors
* [Bantam Tools](https://www.bantamtools.com/) (formerly Othermill) CNC machines

# Software 
* [p5.js](http://p5js.org/) - browser-based JavaScript API based on [Processing](https://www.processing.org), written for beginning programmers. 
* [Vectorworks](http://www.vectorworks.net/) - we rely on the free educational version of Vectorworks' software for [students and educators](http://www.vectorworks.net/education)
*  [Suncalc](https://github.com/mourner/suncalc) is a javascript library for calculating the apparent position of the moon and sun given a date and latlong. [Mooncalc](https://www.mooncalc.org) is the same for the moon.  [This web app by Don Cross](http://cosinekitty.com/solar_system.html) shows the movement on a map of many solar system objects, updating in real time as you move the map.
* [Temporal](https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/docs/) - a proposal to update JavaScript's Date API. Includes non-gregorian calendars, simpler handling of timezones, integration with IANA timezone identifiers, and more. For a useful summary, see [this blog post](https://2ality.com/2021/06/temporal-api.html). Temporal is currently in the proposal stage for inclusion in the JavaScript core, as of July 2021.
