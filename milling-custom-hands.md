# Making Custom Clock Hands

For many different clock designs, we've been using cheap analog clock movements that you can buy in [hobby stores](https://www.michaels.com/075in-clock-movement-kit-with-small-hands-by-artminds/10475422.html) or online from sources like [Klockit](https://www.klockit.com). These clock movements have fairly standardized shaft dimensions for the hour, minute, and second hands, and you can buy a [variety of hands](https://www.michaels.com/metal-clock-hands-by-recollections/10435215.html) for them as well. We wanted to make our own hands, and experimented with milling them using an [Othermill](https://othermachine.co/), a desktop CNC mill.

## Measure The Clock Shafts

They're not all exactly the same. Here are the general dimensions we found for three or four different models:
* **hour hand**: about 5mm diameter, slightly tapered to provide tolerance for different hand designs
* **minute hand**: about 3.3to 3.4mm diameter, with two parallel flatted sides about 2.8mm apart
* **second hand**: a tapered shaft running from about 0.9mm to 1mm diameter. Most second hands are held on with a hollow pin that has a 1mm inner diameter, about 3mm outer diameter.

The dimensions of the shafts varies from manufacturer to manufacturer and model to model, however, so measure the specific one you're using with good calipers. With the material we used, an error of about 0.1 - 0.2mm was workable.
